This repository hosts several language versions of a mini programming-language-like calculator
for the purpose of exploring the use of AI tools in software development.

The intent is that there are different long term TAGs (branches) in the repo
that mark milestones in development so that you can work forward yourself in any language, and
then compare what you did to a reference solution by checking out the "next" step.

STEP_0: NOTHING
STEP_1: Basic Calculator REPL.
STEP_2: Add an exponentiation (^) operator and a factorial (!) operator.
STEP_3: Write a suite of tests for the base calculator

NEXT: Produce AST visualizations for any given expression
